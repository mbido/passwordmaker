# Password maker
This simple yet fun little project creates a password using various techniques.

## Using Markov chains
This technique uses a Markov chain to generate the password.
We analyze a file containing a large amount of text and create the matrix of probabilities of each character following another character.
Then we generate the password by starting with a random character and then choosing the next character based on the probabilities in the matrix.
Using this method we can generate passwords that look like real words. Even more interesting, wa can choose the language of the text file to generate passwords in that language.
